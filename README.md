# Interstellar Vault 🚀

Welcome, spacefarer, to the Interstellar Vault! This is a competitive, level-based smart contract challenge designed to test your Solidity hacking and development skills.

## How to Play

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally to begin your journey:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Contract-battle.git
   cd Contract-battle
   ```
3. Initialize the development environment. You will need **Foundry**.
   
   **To install Foundry:**
   * **Linux & macOS**: 
     ```bash
     curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
     foundryup
     ```
   * **Windows (Git Bash or WSL)**:
     ```bash
     curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
     # Restart terminal or run: source ~/.bashrc
     foundryup
     ```

   Then, setup the project submodules:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

4. **Mission Briefing:** Read your current mission instructions here: [instructions/Level1.md](instructions/Level1.md).
5. Run the local tests to ensure your baseline logic is correct:
   ```bash
   forge test
   ```
6. **Submit using CLI:** When you are ready to face the Judge, do not commit. Instead, simply run:
   ```bash
   ./submit.sh
   ```
   *(Your Pilot Name will be automatically detected safely via your GitHub identity).*
7. **The Galactic Judge:** Your terminal will securely transmit your code to the Central Judge. 
   - A radar ping will appear in your terminal. The Judge is currently compiling and running **secret edge-case tests** against your smart contract.
   - If you pass, your terminal will announce `ACCESS GRANTED` and the Judge will autonomously drop the `Level2.sol` file straight onto your hard drive! 
   - Your name will also be permanently etched into the Leaderboard above.
   - If you fail, access is denied. Examine your code locally and try again!
